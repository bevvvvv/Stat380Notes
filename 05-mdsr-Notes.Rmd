#### Announcements

- Office hours posted in Syllabus
- There are a few more changes to watch for in Ch 5 (see below)
- Keep up with Piazza
- Canvas assignments 
    - MDSR Chap 3 Exercises
    - Programming Notebooks: MDSR Chapter 05


#### MDSR 05 Programming Notebook Tips/Errata

- MDSR Chapter 5 includes several user-defined functions, make sure they are **noted** in the front-matter
    - in other assignments (hwk, projects, etc), user-defined functions should be defined at the beginning per the Style Guide
    - **Since this style is awkward to do so in programming notebooks, so a comment/note in the front-matter is sufficient for user-defined functions and data sources.**
- p. 91: if `hiv_key` fails, try this one: `hiv_key <- "14nH2oKdgDMlgjtLsYM98kxyVMVa5XTkUUkuF0ZrIDgM"`
- p. 94: you may need to load `babynames` from the `babynames` package (although the book doesn't)
- No programming required 
    - p. 99 `BP_wide` (but do not skip the `help(HELPrct)` on p. 98 & Figure 5.2)
    - Section 5.2.1 (include section heading as placeholder)
    - Section 5.2.2 (include section heading as placeholder) 
    - Section 5.2.3 (include section heading as placeholder)
    - Section 5.3   (include section heading as placeholder)
    - Section 5.5.2 (include section heading as placeholder) 
    - Section 5.6 (include section heading as placeholder, also note all the great packages for accessing cool data sources!)
- p. 115: rename the variable in `bstrap` as "mean" after your simulation
- p. 127: some variable names from the Wikipedia table have changed, you'll need to correct them
- p. 127-128: Fig 5.10 is close but not identical due to new Wikipedia data (e.g. reactor shut downs)




## Section 5.1 through 5.3

- We discussed principles of *tidy data* last week
    1. The rows--called *cases* or observational units--each refer to a specific, unique, and similar sort of thing
    2. The columns, called *variables*, each have the same sort of value recorded for each case (i.e. row)
- "Tidy" is not necessarily a singular form for a given data set... 
    - judgement of tidy or not depends on the research question & corresponding definition of "case"
    - data can be converted from one tidy form to another 
    - However, many forms are objectively **NOT** tidy with respect to any research question
- Sec 5.2 discusses reshaping data with `spread()` and `gather()`
- Sec 5.3 Naming conventions & style guides



## Data structures in R

- R data structures can be organized by 
    - dimensionality (1d, 2d, nd) 
    - tolerance for heterogeneous contents (i.e. contents can be different types or not)
- Five common data types

|    | Homogeneous   | Heterogeneous |
|:---|:--------------|:--------------|
| 1d | Atomic vector | List          | 
| 2d | Matrix        | Data frame    |
| nd | Array         |               |

## Atomic vectors

- 1d, homogenous
- usually created with `c()`, short for "combine"
- several types
    - character (e.g., `chr_var <- c("some text", "more stuff", "17")`)
    - double (e.g., `dbl_var <- c(1, 2.5, 4.5)`)--often called "numeric"
    - integer (e.g., `int_var <- c(1L, 6L, 10L)`)--Note L suffix for integer rather than double
    - logical (e.g., `log_var <- c(TRUE, FALSE, T, F)`)
- mixed types results in default coercion to most flexible type present
- `as.numeric()` and other analogous "`as.[type]`" functions can force explicit coercion
- commonly use single square bracket to access element(s) of an atomic vector: `[`

```{r eval=TRUE}
# mixed types coerce by default
logical_01 <- c(TRUE, FALSE, T, F, 1, "0")
class(logical_01)

# explicit coercion
as.logical(logical_01)

# access an element
logical_01[3]
```


## List

- 1d, heterogenous
- elements can be of any type, including lists
- you can turn a list into an atomic vector with `unlist()` following same coercion rules as `c()`
- lists are used to build up many of the more complicated data structures like data frames & model objects
- commonly use {`[`, `[[`, `$`} to access element(s) of a list
    - `[` preserves result as a list, and can access multiple elements
    - `[[` simplifies resulting object (e.g., to vector or data frame)
    - `listName$var` shorthand for `listName[["var"]]`

```{r}
# define a model object
model <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)

# is it a list (yes)
is.list(model)

# inspect the data structure
str(model)

# accesses "residuals" from list & simplifies result to a numeric atomic vector
class(model$residuals)
```


## Data frames

- most common way of storing data in R
- under the hood, a data frame is a list of equal-length vectors
- result is a 2d structure that shares properties with both the matrix and the list
    - access element(s) with `[` by specifying row and column location
    - access and simplify column to vector with `$` (or `[[`)

#### Tibbles (vs. data frame)

- essential part of `tidyverse`
- a tibble is sort of a lazy version of the data.frame
    - it doesn't change the types of inputs (i.e. doesn't convert strings to factors...)
    - it permits use of the back-tick ( ` ) as a workaround for "illegal" names
- the terms (and structures) can often be used interchangeably
- Two differences: 
    - Printing... tibbles just print the first ten rows by default (like a built in `head()` feature)
    - Subsetting... tibbles don't do partial matching & there's an extra step for use of `[`, `$`, or `[[`


## Why the tangent about data structures?  

- consider the `Teams` data from the `Lahman` package
- inspect the data first
    - search the help (`?Teams`)
    - review the structure `str(Teams)`, `head(Teams)`, `tail(Teams)`, etc
    - What's a case?
    - What's a variable?

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
# package
require(Lahman)

# bring into R environment
data("Teams")

# inspect the data s
?Teams      # this only works because it came from an R package... 
str(Teams)
```


## Comparison of team performance metrics

- Research questions
    - How similar are MLB teams with respect to these metrics?
    - Do some metrics widely vary among MLB teams?
- How to approach the problem?

## Bad idea

- calculate the standard deviation for each variable...
- functional but pretty silly

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}

sd(Teams$R, na.rm = TRUE)
sd(Teams$AB, na.rm = TRUE)
sd(Teams$H, na.rm = TRUE)
sd(Teams$X2B, na.rm = TRUE)
sd(Teams$X3B, na.rm = TRUE)
sd(Teams$HR, na.rm = TRUE)
sd(Teams$BB, na.rm = TRUE)
sd(Teams$SO, na.rm = TRUE)
sd(Teams$SB, na.rm = TRUE)
sd(Teams$CS, na.rm = TRUE)
sd(Teams$HBP, na.rm = TRUE)
sd(Teams$SF, na.rm = TRUE)
sd(Teams$RA, na.rm = TRUE)
sd(Teams$ER, na.rm = TRUE)
sd(Teams$ERA, na.rm = TRUE)
sd(Teams$CG, na.rm = TRUE)
sd(Teams$SHO, na.rm = TRUE)
sd(Teams$SV, na.rm = TRUE)
sd(Teams$IPouts, na.rm = TRUE)
sd(Teams$HA, na.rm = TRUE)
sd(Teams$HRA, na.rm = TRUE)
sd(Teams$BBA, na.rm = TRUE)
sd(Teams$SOA, na.rm = TRUE)
sd(Teams$E, na.rm = TRUE)
sd(Teams$DP, na.rm = TRUE)
sd(Teams$FP, na.rm = TRUE)

# and so on...

```

## Better idea

- we're just doing the same operation **for** each column in sequence
- `for` loop?
    - algorithmic solution
    - easy to follow intuition
    - more flexible inputs


```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
# we're interested summarizing several performance metrics in cols 15:40
stDev <- NULL

# simple loop to calculate some averages across specified columns (by index)
for (i in 15:40) {
  stDev[i - 14] <- sd(Teams[, i], na.rm = TRUE)
}

# names(stDev) <- names(Teams)[15:40]

stDev
```

## Vectorized operations

- It's important to understand that the fundamental architecture of R is based on *vectors*
- general-purpose languages like C++ & python distinguish between single items (e.g. strings & integers) and arrays of those items
- in R, a "string" is just a character vector of length 1
- for this reason, R is optimized for vectorized operations 
- this provides an effient alternative to loop-like operations

## `apply()` family

- popular functions designed to vectorize such operations
- `apply(X, MARGIN, FUN, ...)`
    - `X`: the data
    - `MARGIN`: rows, columns, or element-wise
    - `FUN`: **any** function you want (including user-defined functions) 
    - `...`: allows you to pass arguments to FUN
- `lapply(X, FUN, ...)` 
    - **returns a list** of the same length as X, 
    - each element is the result of applying FUN to the corresponding element of X
- `sapply(X, FUN, ..., simplify = TRUE, USE.NAMES = TRUE)`: 
    - sapply is a user-friendly version of lapply
    - **returns a vector** (or matrix) rather than list
- `vapply()`, `tapply()`, `mapply()`, etc.

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
Teams %>%
  select(15:40) %>%
  apply(MARGIN = 2, FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```

## Another Sidebar (user-defined functions)

![](xkcd_general problem.png)

- When? consider writing a function whenever youâ€™ve copied and pasted a block of code more than twice (i.e. you now have three copies of the same code). 
    - Example: we want to rescale some data so the result is between 0 and 1 
    - Here's some code (...including a common error): 

```{r eval=TRUE}
# some simulated data
df <- tibble::tibble(
  a = rnorm(10),
  b = rnorm(10),
  c = rnorm(10),
  d = rnorm(10)
)
```


```{r}
# rescale each variable so the result is between 0 and 1 
df$a <- 
  (df$a - min(df$a, na.rm = TRUE)) / 
  (max(df$a, na.rm = TRUE) - min(df$a, na.rm = TRUE))
df$b <- (df$b - min(df$b, na.rm = TRUE)) / 
  (max(df$b, na.rm = TRUE) - min(df$a, na.rm = TRUE))
df$c <- (df$c - min(df$c, na.rm = TRUE)) / 
  (max(df$c, na.rm = TRUE) - min(df$c, na.rm = TRUE))
df$d <- (df$d - min(df$d, na.rm = TRUE)) / 
  (max(df$d, na.rm = TRUE) - min(df$d, na.rm = TRUE))
```


## Identify Inputs 

- first inspect the code... How many inputs does it have?

```{r eval=TRUE}
(df$a - min(df$a, na.rm = TRUE)) /
  (max(df$a, na.rm = TRUE) - min(df$a, na.rm = TRUE))
```



## Generalize inputs

- now input is a generic vector, `x`

```{r eval=TRUE}
x <- df$a

(x - min(x, na.rm = TRUE)) /
  (max(x, na.rm = TRUE) - min(x, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## Clean up

- note that we utilize a range 3 different times... we can just do that once to clean things up
- is this code easier to read?

```{r eval=TRUE}
x <- df$a
rng <- range(x, na.rm = TRUE)

(x - rng[1]) / (rng[2] - rng[1])
```

## Turn it into a function

- So far, we identified the need for a function, and then 
    - identified inputs,
    - cleaned up code, and 
    - **checked that it still works!**
- Now let's turn it into a function

```{r}
rescale01 <- function(x) {
  rng <- range(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  (x - rng[1]) / (rng[2] - rng[1])
}
```

- Good idea to make notes for yourself
```{r eval=TRUE}
rescale01 <- function(x) {
  # purpose: rescale a vector so the result is between 0 and 1
  # inputs:
  ### x: a quantitative vector
  # outputs: 
  ### result between 0 and 1 for each element after rescaling

  rng <- range(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  (x - rng[1]) / (rng[2] - rng[1])
}
```

- use simple data with known result to check that it works

```{r eval=TRUE}
rescale01(c(0, 5, 10))
```

- live ammo

```{r eval=TRUE}
rescale01(df$a)
rescale01(df$b)
rescale01(df$c)
rescale01(df$d)
```

- right, we can vectorize **any** function!

```{r eval=TRUE}
apply(X = df, MARGIN = 2, FUN = rescale01)
```


## Recap: Writing a new function

- There are three key parts when writing a new function:
    - You need to name the function. (in order--1. informative; 2. concise)
    - List the inputs, or arguments, to the function.
    - Write code for the body of the function

- Note the overall process actually happens in reverse... 
    - I only made the function *after* I figured out how to make it work with a simple input. 
    - Itâ€™s easier to start with working code and turn it into a function; **itâ€™s MUCH harder to create a function and then try to make it work.**



## `dplyr::do()` 

- general purpose complement `filter()`, `select()`, `mutate()`, `summarise()` and `arrange()`
- apply arbitrary function to *groups* of data
    - return either a data frame or arbitrary objects which will be stored in a list. 
    - Particularly useful when working with models by group

## `dplyr::do()` Home Run Leaders Example

- We're interested in identifying the baseball team in each season that led their league in home runs
    - a home run (HR) is when a baseball player hits the ball over the opposing team and out of play
    - the result is one or more automatic points for the team that hit the home run
    - Major League Baseball teams are organized into two "leagues"
        - American League (AL)
        - National League (NL)
- *Goal: write an R function that identifies the team with the most HR's for each league, in each year*
    - Suggest some pseudo code to accomplish this for a specific league (AL) and year (2015)

## Home Run Leaders: trial run

- Let's do a trial run first to make sure we have the body of the code working as intended...

```{r eval=TRUE}
require(Lahman)
data("Teams") 
Teams <- 
  as_tibble(Teams) %>% 
  mutate(lgID = as.character(lgID))

# trial run of the operation
Teams %>%
  filter(yearID == 2015, lgID == "AL") %>%
  select(yearID, lgID, teamID, HR) %>%
  arrange(desc(HR)) %>%
  head(1)  
```

## Home Run Leaders: write the function

- *Goal: write an R function that identifies the team with the most HR's for each league, in each year*
    - we'll want to `group_by(lgID, yearID)`
    - then perform our calculation on each group
    - `dplyr::do()` is good at that
    - we need a function that takes an arbitrary combination of `lgID` and `yearID` and returns the HR leader for that group

```{r eval=TRUE}
hr_leader <- function(x) {
  # return team with the most home runs given year and league
  ### x: a subset of Teams for a single year and league
  x %>%
    select(yearID, lgID, teamID, HR) %>%
    arrange(desc(HR)) %>%
    head(n = 1)
}
```


## Home Run Leaders: test the function

- Make sure the function matches our previous result for the American League in 2015

```{r}
Teams %>%
  filter(yearID == 2015, lgID == "AL") %>%
  dplyr::do(hr_leader(.))
```



## Home Run Leaders: test the function

- All combinations of `lgID` and `yearID`
- We'll store the results this time for later use

```{r}
HrLeaders <- 
  Teams %>%
  group_by(yearID, lgID) %>%
  dplyr::do(hr_leader(.))

HrLeaders %>%
  arrange(desc(yearID)) %>%
  head()
```

## Home Run Leaders: league comparison 

- maybe we want to compare the average and maximum among top teams for each league 
- we can `group_by(lgID)` and `summarise()`

```{r}
HrLeaders %>%
  group_by(lgID) %>%
  summarise(seasons = n(), 
            average = mean(HR, na.rm = TRUE), 
            maximum = max(HR, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## Home Run Leaders: league comparison

- `mosaic` package has some great tools for this and other purposes
- `mosaic` prioritizes the idiom: `function(Y ~ X, data = DATASET)
- `mosaic::favstats()` as an alternative to `summary()`

```{r}
require(mosaic)
favstats(HR ~ lgID, data = HrLeaders)  # additional grouping variables are easy to include
```

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
# base R
summary(HrLeaders)
summary(HrLeaders$HR ~ HrLeaders$lgID)

# apply family can help
tapply(X = HrLeaders$HR, INDEX = HrLeaders$lgID, FUN = summary)

# additional grouping variables take more effort to include...

# Teams %>%
#   filter(lgID %in% c("AL", "NL"), yearID > 2010) %>%
```


## Home Run Leaders: league comparison plot

```{r}
HrLeaders %>%
  filter(yearID >= 1920) %>%   
  ggplot(aes(x = yearID, y = HR, color = lgID)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  geom_smooth(se = 0) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1973) + 
  annotate(geom = "text", x = 1974, y = 25, label = "AL adopts designated hitter rule", hjust = "left") + 
  xlab("Year") + 
  ylab("Most Home Runs by a Single Team") + 
  ggtitle("Comparison of top home run performance by league and year")
```



## How large is difference between NL and AL home run production?

- **Goal: How large is the difference in HR production between leagues since DH rule change?**
    - The American League made a rule change to allow designated hitters in 1973. 
    - How might we approach the problem?  (what model assumptions are required of our data?)


## How large is difference between NL and AL home run production?

- if we use a nonparametric bootstrap we can be less concerned with Normality, but should pay attention to independence
- one way to handle the independence issue is to average over years for each team.  
    - That's a pretty crude approach, but it isn't unreasonable

```{r}
HrProduction <- 
  Teams %>%
  filter(yearID >= 1973) %>%
  select(yearID, lgID, HR) %>%
  group_by(yearID, lgID) %>%  
  summarise(avgHR = mean(HR)) 

LeagueDiffAvgHR <- 
  HrProduction %>%
  spread(key = lgID, value = avgHR) %>%
  mutate(hrAvgDiff = AL - NL)

```

## How large is difference between NL and AL home run production?


```{r}

p <- 
  LeagueDiffAvgHR %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = hrAvgDiff)) + 
  geom_density() + 
  xlim(-20, 50) + 
  xlab("Difference in average home run production since 1984 (AL - NL)")
p

favstats(~ hrAvgDiff, data = LeagueDiffAvgHR)
```


---


## Bootstrapping with `mosaic::do()`

- on average, AL teams hit about 16.5 more home runs per year than NL teams
    - need to estimate the uncertainty of our estimate
    - desired result is an *interval estimate* (e.g. confidence interval)
- bootstrapping
    - `LeagueDiffAvgHR` data has 44 observations
    - we want to estimate the variability of the mean difference
    - we sample WITH replacement from our 44 observations
    - we'll use our distribution of bootstrap means to estimate a confidence interval

```{r}
# resampling with replacement (10k bootstrap samples)
bootstrap <- 
  mosaic::do(750) * mean(~ hrAvgDiff, data = resample(LeagueDiffAvgHR))
head(bootstrap)

# 94% confidence interval--using mosaic::qdata()
civals <- qdata(~ mean, p = c(0.03, 0.97), data = bootstrap)
civals
```

## Bootstrap distribution

```{r}
bootstrap %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x = mean)) + 
  geom_vline(data = civals, aes(xintercept = quantile), color = "red", linetype = 3) + 
  xlab("Bootstrap mean difference in average home run production since 1973 (AL - NL)")
  
```


## Data intake

#### R can read data in lots of different formats...

- R's native file format is ".Rda"
    - `save()` & `load()` commands
    - Note MDSR "pro tip" about separation of cleaning and analysis (p. 116)
- CSV 
    - loads of functions read CSVs
    - `read_csv()` from the `readr` package is a good one
    - `fread()` from the `data.table` package is a good one (and fast)
- Other delimiters: `read_delim()` from the `readr` package 
- software specific formats 
    - Minitab, SAS, SPSS, Weka, ...
- Excel & Google Sheets
- Web (e.g. HTML, XML, JSON)
- API's (application programming interface)

#### some cool packages for data intake

- `foreign`: tools to read data from other software 
- `feather`: for storing data frames that can be read and written by BOTH R and Python
- `twitteR`: twitter API
- `aRxiv`: arXiv API
- `Rfacebook`: facebook API
- `instaR`: instagram API
- `Rflickr`: flickr API (not found?)
- `tumblR`: tumblr API
- `Rlinkedin`: LinkedIn API
- `RSocrata`: API for querying NYC Open Data platform (among other things)



## Dates & Times

- Common classes 
    - "date" 
    - "time" within a day
    - "date-time" (i.e. <dttm>) is an instant in time to nearest second (usually)
- Seems like they should be simple, but can get surprisingly complicated if you are being precise
    - **what are some examples?**
- `lubridate` package has some excellent tools to help
    - `today()` and `now()` come in handy for various reasons
    - parse character strings as dates
    - managing individual date/time components (e.g., "day", "hour")
    - working with existing date/time objects

```{r eval=TRUE}
require(lubridate)

today()
now()
```

## Strings as dates (`lubridate`)

```{r eval=TRUE}
# functions that parse dates as strings
ymd("2008-06-27")
mdy("May 15th, 2008")
mdy("5/15/2019")
dmy("31-Jan-2017")

# date-time
ymd_hms("2017-01-31 20:11:59")
```

## Date/time components (`lubridate`)

- combine individual elements
    - `make_date()`
    - `make_datetime()`

```{r}
require(nycflights13)
data(flights)

# construct datetime of departure
flights %>% 
  select(year, month, day, hour, minute) %>%
  mutate(departure = make_datetime(year, month, day, hour, minute)) %>%
  head(3)
```

## Extracting components of dates

```{r eval=TRUE}
dt <- ymd_hms("2016-07-08 12:34:56")

year(dt)
month(dt)
mday(dt)

yday(dt)
wday(dt)
```


## Example: UK Nuclear Reactors

- Data Intake (web)
- Manage data structures (list to data frame)
- date handling (investigate failures)

```{r}
URL <- "http://en.Wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_reactors"

# scrape all tables from page
tableList <- 
  read_html(URL) %>%
  html_nodes(css = "table")

# locate US table by identifying a famous nuclear reactor
relevantTables <- tableList[grep("Oldbury", tableList)]

# parse html into a data frame
reactorsRaw <- html_table(relevantTables[[1]], fill = TRUE)

# first pass clean up
names(reactorsRaw)[c(3, 4, 6, 7)] <- c("Reactor Type", "Reactor Model", "Capacity Net", "Capacity Gross")
reactors <- reactorsRaw[-1, ]
```

```{r}
# additional clean up
reactors <- 
  reactors %>%
  rename(capacity_net = `Capacity Net`, capacity_gross = `Capacity Gross`) %>%
  mutate(plantstatus = ifelse(grepl("Shut down", reactors$Status), 
                              "Shut down", "Not formally shut down"), 
         capacity_net = parse_number(capacity_net), 
         construct_date = dmy(`Construction start`), 
         operation_date = dmy(`Commercial operation`), 
         closure_date = dmy(Closure))
```

```{r}
reactors %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = operation_date, y = capacity_net, color = plantstatus)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  # geom_smooth() + 
  xlab("Operational date") + 
  ylab("Net plant capacity (MW)")
```

    - RStudio IDE (R, Rmd, Git)


## Git / GitHub

- GitHub's Intro: <https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/>
- "GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere." 
- **Repositories** are used to organize each project
    - These can contain documents, images, folders, code, data, ... basically everything you need for your project 
    - Larger files (> 10-15 MB) need some special handling, but usually not a big deal
    - You'll soon link each **GitHub Repository** to an **RStudio Project** to streamline the workflow
    - Don't put repositories inside other repositories
- Most of your workflow is unchanged
    - As far as your computer is concerned, the repository works just like any other directory (i.e. folder)
    - You edit files, save changes, etc

![Dr. Beckman's Directory to Organize GitHub Repositories](GitHub Directory.png)


## Git / GitHub

- First new part: (**commit**) changes
    - ideally, each commit should encompass *one meaningful modification* 
    - creates a permanent snapshot of the repository
    - you can revisit these snapshots at any time... 
- Second new part: (**push/pull**) to remote
    - GitHub stores the state of your repository in the cloud
    - When you *push*, you update the remote version 
    - Anyone with access to your GitHub repository can *pull* the remote version and work with it
        - This might be you, using a different computer
        - It might be a collaborator 
        - It might be a professor or TA
        - If the repo is made public, it might be a complete stranger!
    - The collaborator can then commit changes and push them to the remote as well 
        - don't worry, there are safeguards in place based on user permissions

## Git / GitHub

- Once configured, nearly all of the action can happen in RStudio
- A "Git" tab will appear in RStudio
- Diff, Commit, Pull, Push are most common actions

## Markdown / R Markdown

- Human-readable syntax by design
- Can "knit" (or preview) same .Rmd to HTML (or PDF or MS Word with some configuration)
- Can produce both notebook, slides, document, webpage, etc as output.
- **Regardless** of intended output, Rmd documents generally require two parts
    - "yaml" header at the top (designated by `---` before/after) includes some document controls
        - title
        - author
        - date
        - output
        - (etc)
    - body of the document including components such as:  
        - Markdown syntax (like hashtag headers)
        - Narrative text
        - Lists (bullets or numbers)
        - Code "chunks" (R, python, SQL, Stan, etc embedded among the narrative of the document)
        - URLs
        - Images
        - Tables
        - and much more...


## Why RMarkdown?

#### RMarkdown lets us separate content from formatting

- Alternative to WYSIWYG's like MS Word & Google Docs 
- Easy to configure headings, lists, TOC, figures, captions, links, images, etc
- Change formatting globally with a css (cascading style sheet)
- Good-looking tables are easy
- Typeset nice-looking mathematics using LaTeX (and some preview)

#### STAT 501 excerpt (inline math)...

Here's the model: 

$log(\frac{\hat{p}_i}{1-\hat{p}_i}) = 3.309 - 0.288(dist_i)$

where $\hat{p}_i$ is the proportion that voted "Yes" for community *i*.


Since the relationship on a logarithmic scale is hard to interpret, we back transform before interpreting coefficients. 

Note: If $e^{\beta_1} = 1$, then it means the odds are 1:1 which translates to a 50-50 chance and means there would be no relationship between the explanatory variable and the odds of "success" (however that's defined in the context of the study).  

#### STAT 501 excerpt (aligned to `=` sign)...

\begin{align*}

\mathit{SSE} &= \Sigma_{i} \left( y_{i} - b_{0} - b_{1}x_{i} \right)^2 \\

\\

\frac{\partial \left( SSE \right)}{\partial b_{0}} &= \Sigma_{i} \left( y_{i} - b_{0} - b_{1}x_{i} \right)^2 \\
 &= \left( -2 \right) \Sigma_{i} \left( y_{i} - b_{0} - b_{1}x_{i} \right) \\
 &= \left( -2 \right) \left( \Sigma y_{i} - \Sigma b_{0} - \Sigma b_{1}x_{i} \right) \\

\\

\frac{\partial \left( SSE \right)}{\partial b_{1}} &= \Sigma_{i} \left( y_{i} - b_{0} - b_{1}x_{i} \right)^2 \\
 &= \Sigma_{i} \left( -2x_{i} \right) \left( y_{i} - b_{0} - b_{1}x_{i} \right) \\
 &= \left( -2\right) \Sigma_{i} \left( x_{i} y_{i} - x_{i} b_{0} - b_{1}x_{i}^2 \right) \\
 &= \left( -2\right) \left( \Sigma x_{i} y_{i} - \Sigma x_{i} b_{0} - \Sigma b_{1}x_{i}^2 \right) \\

\end{align*}


## (my) STAT 184 Philosophy

- "less-volume, more creativity"  
- A few simple tools can be combined in powerful ways
- Individually these tools are introduced as "data moves" 
- The complexity comes from combining these simple tools in order to achieve our specific purposes
- `tidyverse` sub-language accomplishes this purpose within an ecosystem predicated upon so-called "Tidy" data.

## Tidy Data

- "Neat" is not the same as "Tidy"
- *Tidy data* are organized according to two simple rules: 
    1. The rows--called *cases* or observational units--each refer to a specific, unique, and similar sort of thing
    2. The columns, called *variables*, each have the same sort of value recorded for each case (i.e. row)
- Galton's family data
    - Are these data tidy?
    - What is a case?
    - What are the variables?

![A page from Francis Galton's notebook.](galton-notebook.jpg)


```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# package
require(mosaicData)  

# intake data from `mosaicData` package
data("Galton")

head(Galton, 10)
```

## `tidyverse` command chains

- Each link in the chain is a "data verb" or "data move"  with its arguments
    - The very first link is typically a data table.
    - Links are connected by the pipe: `%>%`
- Often, but not always, you will store the result of the chain in a named object
    - This is done with the *assignment operator*, `<-`
- New line for each link
- Note that `%>%` is at the end of each line.  **Except**
    - `Hazels <-` is an assignment
    - Last line has no `%>%` (otherwise R thinks there's more)


```{r}
# package
require(DataComputing)

# intake data
data("BabyNames")

# a command chain
Hazels <- 
  BabyNames %>%
  filter(grepl("Hazel", name)) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(count))
```

## Parts of speech

- Data set
- function
- argument
- variables
- constants

#### Discussion question

```{r eval=FALSE}
Hazels <- 
  BabyNames %>%
  filter(grepl("Hazel", name)) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(count))
```

Just from the syntax, you should be able to tell which of the five different kinds of object each of these things is: 

- `Hazels` 
- `BabyNames` 
- `filter` 
- `grepl` 
- `"Hazel"` 
- `name` 
- `group_by` 
- `year` 
- `summarise` 
- `total` 
- `sum` 
- `count`


## Small group discussion: 

- Explain each of these common `tidyverse` functions:
    - **List 1--data joins & reshape:**
        - `left_join()`
        - `inner_join()`
        - `spread()`
        - `gather()`
    - **List 2--data verbs:**
        - `mutate()`
        - `filter()`
        - `select()`
        - `arrange()`
    - **List 3--more data verbs:**
        - `head()` & `tail()`
        - `transmute()`
        - `rename()`
        - `sample_n()`
        - `summarise()` & `group_by()`
    - **List 4--summary functions:**
        - `glimpse()`
        - `str()`
        - `summary()`
        - `nrow()` & `ncol()`
        - `names()`
        - `View()`
- Are there functions that no one in the group understood?



## Kinds of join


Different joins have different answers to these questions.

* What to do when there is **no match** between a left case and any right case?
* What to do when there are **multiple matching cases** in the right table for a case in the left table?


Popular join types: 

- `left_join()`: joins matching rows from the *right* table to the *left* table
- `inner_join()`: only retain rows for which a match exists

<br>

#### IF no right cases match the left case...

- `left_join()`: Keep the left case and fill in the new variables (from the right table) with `NA`
- `inner_join()`: Discard the left case.

<br>

#### IF multiple right cases match the left case...

`left_join()` and `inner_join()` do the same thing:

* `left_join()`: Keep **all combinations**.
* `inner_join()`: Keep **all combinations**.

<br>

#### Other useful joins:

* `full_join()` Keep left case as well as unmatched right cases.
* `semi_join()` Discard left case corresponding to unmatched right case.
* `anti_join()` Keep the left case but discard any left case with a match in the right table


## Reshaping data

- `gather()` stacks columns to convert from wide to narrow
- `spread()` unstacks columns to convert narrow to wide


```{r}
require(dplyr)
# From http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1181060
Stocks <- tibble(
  time = as.Date('2009-01-01') + 0:9,
  X = rnorm(10, 0, 1),
  Y = rnorm(10, 0, 2),
  Z = rnorm(10, 0, 4)
)

# inspect data
Stocks

# gather/stack/melt--wide to narrow
StocksNarrow <- 
  Stocks %>% 
  gather(key = stock, value = price, X, Y, Z)  

StocksNarrow 

# spread/unstack/cast--narrow to wide
StocksWide <- 
  StocksNarrow %>% 
  spread(key = stock, value = price)

StocksWide
```



## Grammar of graphics

- the framework underpinning `ggplot2` intends to implement priniciples and philosophy set in Wilkonson's 2005 book *The Grammer of Graphics (2nd Ed.)*
- using tidy data, each *case* corresponds to a *glpyh* or mark on the graph.

#### SAT Scores & Student Spending by State in the US

```{r}
require(mdsr)
data("SAT_2010")

# 2010 SAT Scores grouped by participation rate
SAT_2010 <- 
  SAT_2010 %>%
  mutate(SAT_rate = cut(sat_pct, breaks = c(0, 30, 60, 100), 
                        labels = c("low", "medium", "high")))

# initialize scatter plot
g <- 
  SAT_2010 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = expenditure, y = math)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = 0) + 
  xlab("Average expenditure per student ($1000)") + 
  ylab("Average score on math SAT")

# base plot showing SAT Math vs Student expenditure
g
```

```{r}
# color scatter plot by SAT_rate
g + 
  aes(color = SAT_rate)
```


#### Anatomy of a data visualization

- Frame
- Glyph
- Aesthetic
- Scale
- Guide (legend)
- Facet


```{r}
# facet by SAT participation rate
g + 
  facet_wrap( ~ SAT_rate)
```


## Layers 

#### Medicare costs in Pennsylvania among other states

```{r}
require(mdsr)
data("MedicareCharges", package = "mdsr")   # from mdsr, not DataComputing

# Pennsylvania medicare charges
ChargesPA <- 
  MedicareCharges %>%
  filter(stateProvider == "PA")
```

```{r fig.height=3, fig.width=8}
# Plot Pennsylvania data
p <- 
  ChargesPA %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(drg, mean_charge), y = mean_charge)) + 
  geom_bar(fill = "gray", stat = "identity") +   # stat = "identity" ==> value dictates bar height
  ylab("Statewide Average Charges ($)") + 
  xlab("Medical Procedure (DRG)") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
p
```


```{r fig.height=3, fig.width=8}
# add layer to show other states for reference
p + 
  geom_point(data = MedicareCharges, size = 1, alpha = 0.3)
```


## Fivethirtyeight reproduction (MDSR p. 50)

![](josephsFivethirtyeight.png)

## MDSR Reproduction

```{r}
require(mdsr)
require(Hmisc)

BabynamesDist <- make_babynames_dist()  # from mdsr

Joseph <- BabynamesDist %>%
  filter(name == "Joseph" & sex == "M")

# constructing the base plot
name_plot <- 
  Joseph %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(y = count_thousands * alive_prob), 
           fill = "#b2d7e9", color = "white") + 
  geom_line(aes(y = count_thousands), size = 2) + 
  ylab("Number of People (thousands)") + 
  xlab(NULL)

# base plot
name_plot
```

```{r}
median_yob <- wtd.quantile(x = Joseph$year, weights = Joseph$est_alive_today, probs = 0.5)
median_yob
```

- note the clever use of `ifelse` to create a new histogram with one non-zero bar at `median_yob`
- add titles
- add text labels (improve fonts)
- add curved arrow
- add improvements
    - better fonts
    - better titles
    - better frame
    - etc
```{r}
name_plot <- 
  name_plot + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", color = "white", fill = "#008fd5", 
           aes(y = ifelse(year == median_yob, est_alive_today / 1000, 0))) 

# Figure 3.22: Josephs (improved)
name_plot + 
  ggtitle(label = "Age Distribution of American Boys Named Joseph", subtitle = "By year of birth") + 
  geom_text(x = 1935, y = 40, size = 3.5, family = "mono", label = "Number of Josephs \n born each year") + 
  geom_text(x = 1915, y = 13, size = 3.5, family = "mono", color = "#008fd5", 
            label = "Number of Josephs \n born each year \n estimated to be alive \n on Jan. 1, 2014") + 
  geom_text(x = 2003, y = 40, size = 3.5, family = "sans", color = "darkgray",
            label = "The median\nliving Joseph\nis 37 years old.") + 
  geom_curve(x = 1995, xend = 1974, y = 40, yend = 24, 
             arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.3, "cm")), curvature = 0.5) + 
  ylim(0, 42) + 
  theme_fivethirtyeight()
  
```




## Three Important Concepts 

1. Data can be usefully organized into tables with "cases" and "variables."  
    - In "tidy data" every case is the same sort of thing (e.g. a person, a car, a year, a country in a year) 
    - We sometimes even modify data in order to change what the cases represent in order to better represent a point.

#. Data graphics and "glyph-ready" data
    - each case corresponds to a "glyph" (mark) on the graph
    - each variable to a graphical attribute of that glyph such as x- or y-position, color, size, length, shape, etc. 
    - same is true for more technical tools (e.g., models) 

#. When data are not yet in glyph-ready form, you can transform (i.e. wrangle) them into glyph-ready form.  
    - Such transformations are accomplished by performing one or more of a small set of basic operations on data tables
    - This is the work of data "verbs"
